remember to add game.js instead of classes.js! also, edit game.js and add some code of minecraft 1.16.5! 
1.21 eagler and other versions are paused till this is done!
**Turns out eagler 1.12 javascript port is in progress**
so i took the classes.js and classes.js.map and fixed a small error and edited it a bit. REAL game code will come in soon!
